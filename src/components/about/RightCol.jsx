                    I am a web developer from Croatia living in Berlin, Germany. Application development, problem-solving, and web development are my passions. To
                    create amazing apps, I utilize the MERN stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to being a developer, I have been a video editor and a motion designer as well as having a Master's Degree in Journalism. Programming,
                    however, feels like home to me, as it combines my love for learning and abstract thinking with creativity and curiosity.

                <p>
                    Whenever I'm not coding, you can find me with friends, at a caf√© or bar, watching a concert, playing guitar, swimming, reading a book, or playing
                    chess.
